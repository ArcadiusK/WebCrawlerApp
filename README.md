# Risk Analysis

Risk Advisor use Public Big Data to retrieve and analyze the "Risk Factors" for US publicly traded companies. Publicly available data sources (such as 10-K) are retrieved to create profiles for the companies and segment them based on their "risk factors" and "needs."

## Prequisite

Be sure the followings are installed successfully on your machine.

*   Tomcat 6+
*   Java 1.5
*   Ant
*   MongoDB 2+
*   Git

## Build from Source

There are two places you can clone from.

* From GitHub

This is a public project, so you can clone the repo directly.

```
cd your_workspace_path
git clone git@github.com:Gonghan/WebCrawlerApp.git
cd WebCrawlerApp
ant
```

* From Jazz Hub

```
cd your_workspace_path
git clone https://hub.jazz.net/git/gonghan/WebCrawlerApp
cd WebCrawlerApp
ant
```

* Tomcat configurations
  * Go to the directory of your tomcat.
  * Go to your_tomcat/conf
  * Open server.xml
  * Add this line into the <host> tag.
  
  ```
  <Context docBase="your_workspace/WebCrawlerApp/webStarterApp.war" path="/" reloadable="true"/>
  ```
  Here the **webStarterApp.war** is the compressed file generated by running **ant**. You can modify the **build.xml** to use a more meaningful name.

## Import into IDE

I recommend [Eclipse EE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2) as the IDE for this project.

 * Import the downloaded source code into Eclipse EE.
 * Add all the jars in the WebContent/lib/ into the project build path.
 * Strongly recommend you create a web server(tomcat) inside Eclipse and continue the [tomcat configurations]()
