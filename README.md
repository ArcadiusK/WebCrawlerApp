## Build from Source

There are two places you can clone from.

* From GitHub

This is a public project, so you can clone the repo directly.

'''
cd your_workspace_path
git clone git@github.com:Gonghan/WebCrawlerApp.git
cd WebCrawlerApp
ant
'''

* From Jazz Hub

'''
cd your_workspace_path
git clone https://hub.jazz.net/git/gonghan/WebCrawlerApp
cd WebCrawlerApp
ant
'''
* Tomcat configuration
  * Go to the directory of your tomcat.
  * Go to your_tomcat/conf
  * Open server.xml
  * Add this line into the <host> tag.
  
  '''
  <Context docBase="your_workspace/WebCrawlerApp/webStarterApp.war" path="/" reloadable="true"/>
  '''
  Here the **webStarterApp.war** is the compressed file generated by running **ant**. You can modify the **build.xml** to use a more meaningful name.
